A Mountable hosts all the logic to create, measure, and bind the content the Mountable Component will render.

`MountableComponent.render()` method should return a `Mountable` implementation and any `Style` object you want to apply to the component on the `MountableWithStyle` object.

:::note
Mountable extends [RenderUnit](introduction-to-rendercore.mdx/#renderunit) - a rendering primitive. You can [learn more about RenderUnit and RenderCore](introduction-to-rendercore.mdx).

## The lifecycle of a Mountable

A Mountable has four important phases in its lifecycle, which happen in the following order:

1. measuring the size of the content (can happen on any thread)
2. creating content (can only happen on the main thread)
3. binding (setting) content properties (can only happen on the main thread)
4. unbinding (unsetting) content properties (can only happen on the main thread)

You can learn more about each of these phases in the sections below.

## Creating a Mountable

In order to create a Mountable you should write an class that extends the [Mountable](pathname:///javadoc/com/facebook/rendercore/Mountable.html) abstract class. Implementations directly extending the `Mountable` class allow you to specify multiple [Binders](introduction-to-rendercore.mdx/#binder) to set and unset properties on the mounted content.

In the majority of cases a single `Binder` will be enough to implement the binding required for your `MountableComponent`.

For this reason a `SimpleMountable` abstract class has been created for you to implement. It encapsulates the logic of the `Binder` creation and addition, and you should just override `mount()`, `unmount()` and optionally `shouldUpdate()` method to implement setting and unsetting the properties on the content.

You can see an example implementation of a SimpleMountable below:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/mountables/SimpleImageViewComponent.kt start=start_simple_mountable_example end=end_simple_mountable_example
```

## Measuring the size of the content

Each Mountable should implement a `measure()` function to define how a Mountable should measure itself given arbitrary width and height specs. A `MeasureResult` object it returns should contain the width and height of the content, and optionally any layout data.

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/mountables/bindto/ImageViewComponent.kt start=measure_example_start end=measure_example_end
```

You can [learn different strategies to measure the content](mountable-measuring.mdx).

## Content creation

Each Mountable needs to create the content it hosts (either a `View` or a `Drawable`) via a [ContentAllocator](introduction-to-rendercore.mdx/#contentallocator).

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/mountables/bindto/ImageViewComponent.kt start=create_content_example_start end=create_content_example_end
```

You should also pass the type of the created content to the `Mountable` super constructor, either `RenderType.VIEW` for Views or `RenderType.DRAWABLE` for Drawables.

:::note
The content should not be mutated based on props passed from MountableComponent to the Mountable.
:::

In order to optimize the mount performance, the `ContentAllocator` can also be used to define a content pooling strategy. You can [follow dedicated documentation page to implement this concept](mountable.mdx).

## Binding the content

A Mountable uses one or more [Binders](introduction-to-rendercore.mdx/#binder) to set and unset properties on the mounted content.

Each Binder should implement 3 methods:
- bind() - used to set properties
- unbind() - used to unset properties
- shouldUpdate() - used to decide whether properties need resetting

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/mountables/bindto/ImageViewComponent.kt start=mount_unmount_example_start end=mount_unmount_example_end
```

Each `Binder` should be added to the `Mountable` using the `addMountUnmountExtension()` method.

:::note
It is important that once set, a property should be unset in the matching `unbind()` method to ensure correctness when the content is reused.
