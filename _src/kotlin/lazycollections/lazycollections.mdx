## Motivation

A simple, but non-scalable method to render a list of components is to use a `Column` or `Row` container:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/collection/FriendsCollectionKComponent.kt start=start_column_example end=end_column_example
```

The above example creates a `Column` and adds child `Text` component for each friend. It's made scrollable by wrapping it in a `VerticalScroll`.

*** This approach is inefficient and inflexible when dealing with many items, or when the items are expected to be updated. ***

Consider if there were 100 friends. During the layout of the `Column` you would also layout 100 `Text` components, despite only a few being visible on the screen. If one of the names was updated or changed position, a layout of all 100 `Text` components would be triggered and the change would be applied without an animation.

## Lazy Collections

Lazy collections are components that can efficiently render a scrollable list of child components using Android's `RecyclerView`.

Lazy collections are available as follows:

* [LazyList](https://github.com/facebook/litho/blob/master/litho-widget-kotlin/src/main/kotlin/com/facebook/litho/widget/collection/LazyList.kt)
* [LazyGrid](https://github.com/facebook/litho/blob/master/litho-widget-kotlin/src/main/kotlin/com/facebook/litho/widget/collection/LazyGrid.kt)
* [LazyStaggeredGrid](https://github.com/facebook/litho/blob/master/litho-widget-kotlin/src/main/kotlin/com/facebook/litho/widget/collection/LazyStaggeredGrid.kt).

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/collection/FriendsCollectionKComponent.kt start=start_lazy_list_example end=end_lazy_list_example
```

The above example creates a `LazyList` and adds a child `Text` component for each list item. It doesn't require all children to be laid out to start showing content on screen. When adding children to a Column, you must specify an `id` parameter on each child, which is required for [applying updates correctly](lazycollections-working-with-updates.mdx).
