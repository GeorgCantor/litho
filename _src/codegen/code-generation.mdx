This page covers the old Java Spec API. If you aren't using the Spec API, refer to the [Components](../mainconcepts/components-basics.mdx) page.

Litho relies on code generation in order to create *Components* from *Component Specs*. This process utilises intermediate *ComponentSpec* representations called [SpecModels](pathname:///javadoc/com/facebook/litho/specmodels/model/SpecModel.html), which are immutable Java objects.

Code generation consists of three steps, as detailed in the following sections.

## 1. Spec model creation

Spec models are created at compile time using an annotation processor, which is a tool in javac for scanning and processing annotations. The Litho annotation processor processes the annotations, methods and fields on your Component Specs and creates a Spec Model for each one.

## 2. Spec model validation

Spec Models have a method called `validate()` that returns a list of [SpecModelValidationErrors](pathname:///javadoc/com/facebook/litho/specmodels/model/SpecModelValidationError.html). If this list is empty, then the Spec is well-formed and may be used to generate a valid Component. If not, then it will contain a list of errors that need to be fixed before a valid Component is generated.

## 3. Component generation

If the validation step on a Spec Model is successful, then the `generate` method may be called. This creates a [Javapoet](https://github.com/square/javapoet) `TypeSpec`, which can then be easily used to create a Component class file.
