Mountable Components can be used to render views or drawables on the screen.

There is a lot of similarities between Mountable Components and [KComponents](/mainconcepts/components-basics.mdx) - they both consist of a render function that can use the component's props and [Hooks](mainconcepts/hooks-intro.mdx).

The render function of a Mountable Component returns a MountableWithStyle object which contains a Mountable that should be rendered, as well as a Style object that should be applied to the Mountable Component.

:::note
The `render()` method can be invoked from multiple threads - you should NOT assume it can only be called from the main thread. The implementation of render should not cause side effects, and essentially be like a pure function.
:::

A Mountable represents a reusable unit responsible for hosting the logic to create, measure, and bind the content the Mountable Component will render. You can learn more about Mountable on the [following page](mountable.mdx).

The following example shows a Mountable Component that will return a Mountable which creates an ImageView to be rendered on the screen.

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/mountables/SimpleImageViewComponent.kt start=start_simple_mountable_component_example end=end_simple_mountable_component_example
```

Similarly to KComponents, there are specific [rules to follow to ensure correctness](/mainconcepts/components-basics.mdx/#rules-for-components).

Mountable Components can be [configured using Common Props and State just like KComponents](/mainconcepts/components-basics.mdx/#other-ways-to-configure-components).
