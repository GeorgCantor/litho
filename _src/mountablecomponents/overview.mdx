In this section you can find information about Mountable Components, which are a replacement for the old Java Specs API-based [Mount Specs](codegen/mount-specs.md) - components that can render views or drawables.

Mountable Components should only be created when you need to integrate your own views/drawables with Litho. Here, *Mount* refers to the operation performed by all components in a layout tree to extract their rendered state (a 'View' or a 'Drawable') to be displayed.

The following pages provide additional information:

* [Mountable Component](mountable-component.mdx) - how to create a Component responsible for rendering a View or Drawable.
* [Mountable](overview.mdx) - the object responsible for hosting the logic to create, measure, and bind the content the Mountable Component will render.
* [Measuring](overview.mdx) - learn different strategies to measure the content the Mountable Component will render.
* [Accessibility](accessibility.mdx) - how to implement [A11Y](https://www.a11yproject.com/) for your Mountable Components.
* [Dynamic Values](overview.mdx) - how to use props that are updated without computing a layout or remounting.
* [Controllers](overview.mdx) - the API used to control the content from outside the Component (typically from an ancestor).
* [Content pooling](overview.mdx) - a performance optimisation strategy that can be used to populate the content pools to improve first mount performance.
* Advanced: [RenderCore](introduction-to-rendercore.mdx) - overview of the engine responsible for rendering Mountable Components.
